Hello, 
 I must say that i don't have a clue about js but I thought it was a fun design and i wanted to do it. Any reviews about the html and css will be highly appreciated!!

!important: I have no knowledge of js, therefor i had imported and modified the code for hamburger menu from https://dev.to/devggaurav/let-s-build-a-responsive-navbar-and-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-4gci, and for the accordion from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp.
